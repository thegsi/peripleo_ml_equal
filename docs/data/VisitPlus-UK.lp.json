The exposed section of the flint has been worked creating three visible long sloping faces and a flat upper surface on the upper dorsal side. The ventral front edge has been worked with short, scaled semi-abrupt retouch. The flint is a black to translucent brown colour. The body of the flint is wrapped in a piece of folded lead, or \"flint pad\", intended to hold it in place within the jaws of a cock or hammer on a flintlock firearm. There appears to be a partial impression from the lock clamp on the upper surface of the lead. Measurements: length 33.01mm, width 24.07mm, thickness 11.81mm, weight 17.46g. Discussion: Other recorded gunflints with lead pads include BERK-736C0C; KENT-CBEAF2 and NMS-A24189 which notes that the flintlock was introduced in the middle of the 16th century and became the main regulation firearm for the British Army during the reign of William III. The knapped flint was used within the musket mechanism to produce a spark and could last between 20-25 shots before it had to be replaced.",

          "label": "A complete&nbsp;silver finger ring of probable medieval date (c.1000-1200). Description: The ring is sub-circular in plan, with the back section of the hoop being rectangular in cross-section and the front sub-circular, being formed with three twisted sub-rectangular wires which have been split from the band.&nbsp;At some points on the wires, possible peck marks are evident which were used to test the quality of the silver.&nbsp; Measurements:&nbsp;diameter: 24mm; width: 3.8mm; thickness: 1.2mm; height (of bezel): 3.5mm; weight: 3.91g Discussion: Typically, silver finger rings formed of twisted wire have a very narrow back such as NCL-40E866, sometimes the join of two tapering ends such as&nbsp;KENT-4D4DB5, both of which are attributed to Viking production and dated c.800-1100. Those with rectangular backs such as the one recorded here are less common but include&nbsp;SUSS-6F8D1D, dated c.800-1100, and which references multiple gold parallels including&nbsp;YORYM-F67716&nbsp;dated 9th-11th century.&nbsp; It also references an almost identical example to the ring recorded here in the British Museums collections (1854,0820.6) which was &#39;...found in the Lark Hill Hoard near Worcester. This hoard is dated to the 12th century by the presence of coins contained therein, but the ring is described in the British Museum&#39;s collection database as being &#39;a common type of Viking and late Anglo-Saxon ring&#39;. KENT-EA1868&nbsp;is the closest parallel that could be found on the database and includes the following discussion: ...the twisted hoop type of Viking origin is long-lived in Denmark, in fact into the early 12th century, while in England, a ring of plain rods with a plain section hammered square at the back was found in the Lark Hill Hoard, deposited later around 1173-1174 (F. Lindahl, 2003, Symboler I guld og s&oslash;lv, Nationalmuseets fingerringe 1000-1700-&aring;rene, Copenhagen, 11-13, figs. 3 and 12).&nbsp; It also refers to &#39;...a silver-gilt ring of alternating twisted rods and finer twisted wires with a long, plain, rectangular section at the back, like the one from Old Romney, from a late 13th or early 14th-century context at Hangleton, Sussex (E.W. Holden, 1963, &#39;Excavations at the deserted medieval village of Hangleton, part 1&#39;, Sussex Archaeological Collections, 54-181, fig. 38, 18). The form and structure of both these rings are closely comparable with a further silver stray find from either England, or possibly the Near East, in the Haedeke Collection (H.-U. Haedeke, 2000, Schmuck aus drei Jahrtausenden, Cologne, 86, cat.no. 118)&#39;.&nbsp; It concludes: &#39;It would appear from the occurrences in early Medieval contexts, therefore, that such rings of multiple, twisted rods with longish arcs of square section at the back of the hoop and less &#39;corrugated&#39; appearance represent a development of the Viking form and can be dated to the Romanesque period.&#39; A date of c.1000-1200 is therefore suggested for the example recorded here.",

The surface extending from the flat side of the blade steeply convex and the opposing side extending from the midrib side is gently convex and almost flat. The tang measures12.44mm at the base of the blade tapering to a point. It thickens from 7.68mm tapering to 1.75mm at the tip. The side profile of the tang terminates in a curve with a sharply upturned tip.The object is covered in pale green corrosion, but is a bright copper underneath. Measurements: length: 91.86mm; width: 32.78mm; thickness of blade: 7.31mm and weight: 51.75g. Discussion: The upturned tang would have held the original wood, bone or antler handle in place.

They were used as horse accoutrements to join leather straps such as on cheek pieces, bits and harness links of the period. Williams suggests an 11th century date but indicates they may have had a longer life in England. Cf. Williams (Ibid), p. 3.&nbsp;",

          "label": "A fragment of a gilt silver finger ring of medieval date (c.1300-1500). Description: The fragment represents the quatrefoil bezel of the ring and part of the hoop to which the bezel is soldered on the underside. The bezel has at its centre a four branches or leaves, probably palm leaves symbolising the four gospels which tell of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem. These are represented by engraved recesses creating the spaces between the leaves of the palms. Each quadrant of the bezel is impressed with a different motif which clockwise are as follows: an 'I'; '[h]'; 'C'; and finally, a flared-arm cross. The Christogram initials IhC are in lombardic lettering and denote the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus. The cast symbols in relief create impressed circular surrounding fields, in turn creating a raised border around the edge of the bezel as well as between each quadrant. Measurements: length: 13.4mm; width: 11.9mm; thickness: 2.67mm; weight: 1.44g Discussion: Finger rings with similar applied quatrefoil bezels have been reported through the treasure act and recorded onto the PAS database. Those with simple bezels (LANCUM-254BF6 and LANCUM-0E7C1A) are dated 14th century and 14th-15th century respectively, while NMS-093C14 has been more broadly dated to c.1450-1700. WMID-D4CD51 and SOM-F8FE47, whose bezels both feature foliate designs, are dated 13th-15th century and 14th century respectively while SUR-D2DFEA, which has a moulded face at the centre of the bezel, is dated late 14th to 17th century. A more decorative ring, with stone-set shoulders and ruby set in the centre of a quatrefoil bezel engraved with palm leaves which is dated 14th century can be seen in Oman (1993, P. 11, No. 261). The phrase “Ihc nazarenus rex iudeorum” was inscribed above the head of Jesus on the cross during his crucifixion. It is a phrase which was commonly employed on medieval objects, primarily, finger rings and brooches, for their perceived magical qualities in curing or averting illness and misfortune. The IhC Jesus invocation cult gained popularity in the mid 14th century before becoming embroiled in the religious turmoil of the 16th and 17th centuries, some seeing the practise as popish with catholic connotations. A date range of c.1300- 1500 is therefore suggested for the example recorded here. Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this object likely dates to before 1721 and as the object is made of more than 10% precious metals, it constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",

          "label": "Small fragment of a medieval (14th or 15th century) decorated floor tile. The fragment is broadly sub-rectangular consisting of only one lower part of a much large square or rectangular tile. The fabric of the tile is relatively hard with a number of angular and sub-angular quartz (both abundant rose and infrequent white) iron stone and grit inclusions. The fabric is also mica rich. The fabric colour is a uniform mid orange brown. The fabric has a series of crack like voinds where the clay forming it has been folded and worked. The upper surface of the tile has been decorated with a pattern due to the size it is difficult to understand what the overall pattern was. It is possible that this was part of a larger design comprising four tile tessellating block as the linking design; alternatively it may be a decorated runner / half tile from the border of a larger pavement. What remains of the design consists of three horizontal blobs of yellow pipe clay; with the eye of faith the rear and foot of a lion passant can be seen, likewise these gould be elements of a crude vegetal scroll. All of these designs have been formed by impressing the surface of the tile with a die to create the pattern. The pattern is then filled with a white (usually pipe) clay wash that fills the stamped design. This has been further augmented by the application of a yellow coloured glaze / wash to the entire is upper surface. When fired this has produced a two tone yellow / brown red pattern present on this tile. Much of this surface has decayed and been lost and the pipe clay has deteriorated slightly and is now a mid buff / pale yellow colour. Only one part of the original edge of teh tile survives - all others are broken. There is no evidence of mortar on any of the surfaces of the tile. This suggests that they were laid either on a bed of sand or straight onto a leveled beaten earth floor. The upper surface with the design impressed upon it is smoother than the other faces and this might be a direct result of in situ wear. This style of two tone decorative floor tile is relatively common in both churches and high status secular buildings dating from the later medieval period 1300-1450. Comparative studies with other medieval tiles from Much Wenlock and across teh county have been undertaken and a similar example of this design has not been found. The tile measures 72.0mm length, 84.4mm width, is 26.1mm thick and weighs 198 grams.",

          "label": "A cast copper alloy axe or knife blank / ingot of Chalcolithic / Early Bronze Age date (2450 - 2300 BC). The blank is oval in shape with the butt being rounded narrowed and tapered. In profile it is lentoid in shape and its cross section is a similar lentoid shape. The 'cutting' edge is rounded, from the external edges it tapers gradually until it forms a narrowed but rounded but. There is no sign of a stop ridge or any form of cast design. It is thickest at the mid-point. The surface of the blank is heavily eroded and corroded, small areas of original patinated surface survive but on the whole the surface is pitted and corroded with an eroded surface. It is a dark - mid green colour. The metallic composition of the knife has been analysed by Dr Eleanor Blakelock, Birmingham Museums Trust. Her report is produced below: X-ray florescence analysis was undertaken on the surface of the objects using a Bruker M1 Mistral desktop XRF in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery conservation laboratory. The results suggests that the axe blank is a copper rich alloy with trace elements of arsenic, antinomy, lead and silver. This composition is typical for an Early Bronze Age date. The analysis however was carried out on the surface of the corroded object therefore the results may not be entirely representative of the core alloy of the dagger/knife. The form of this blank is similar to a number that Dr Stuart Needham has highlighted in his work on the Early Bronze Age metalwork from the Welsh Marches. Dr Needham was kind enough to examine this artefact and confirmed that he felt it was an unfinished or unworked blank because a) the profiles were unsymmetrical and b) the unrefined shape in plan being sub-trapezoidal or oval in shape c) the xrf results indicate an alloy of early composition. The axe-blank measures 77.6mm in length, 35.9mm width, and is 5.5mm thick. It weighs 59.87 grams.",

The lower part of the bow, foot of the brooch, catch plate, rearward facing hook, pin, spring, axis bar and both wing caps are all missing. The remains of the brooch consist of the head and upper part of the bow. The bow head is hump-like, and slightly angular (comma shaped) in profile. The bow is broad and tapers to a damaged rounded terminal, with a well-developed patina. At the rear of the head of the brooch is a recess that would have held the coiled spring and pin which are both now missing. A ridge is present at the shoulder between the wings and the bow. There is a central incised groove running the length of the remains of the bow. The object has a green to mid brown coloured even patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail. There are many similar examples on the database that have been found across the West Midlands, one example was discovered in Bidford on Avon, Warwickshire (WAW-E3B44C) and (WMID-B4FBF5) discovered in Birmingham. Bayley and Butcher (2004:160) comment that the distribution of Polden Hill brooches is concentrated in the West Midlands. Similar brooches are illustrated by Bayley and Butcher (2004:p.88-89).

There is a casting flaw leaving a hole in one face of the lower blade. Most of the blade has broken off and is missing, and the break is patinated. The midrib has a lozenge shaped cross-section. The mouth of the socket may be broken too - it ends unusually close to the loops and the side curve outwards. There is also a tear in one face of the socket.

          "label": "TREASURE CASE : 2021 T521 Description: An incomplete silver cuff link of Post-Medieval date, circa AD 1662 - 1700. Only one circular cuff link remains from a pair of cuff links, which would have been joined together via a chain loop. The surviving cuff link is formed from a circular, flat disc with a flared rim. The rim has become detached from the central disk where it would have bent back from the face and is distorted out of shape, but remains associated with the central disk. The circular disc has been pressed to form the front design. The design features clasped, gloved hands, surmounted by a single double-arched crown, with two flaming hearts below. The entire design sits inside a raised border. The pressed design can be seen on the reverse of the disc. In the centre of the reverse the attachment loop can be seen. The loop has a circular section and appears to have been soldered to the reverse. Dimensions: Length: 12.0mm; Width: 12.0mm; Thickness: 4.0mm; Weight: 0.6g. Discussion: Cuff links and buttons featuring similar designs of this style are considered to have originally been produced to commemorate the marriage of Charles II to Catherine of Braganza in 1662. The design did however continue to be used as a general symbol of love and marriage. Similar examples have been recorded as Treasure through the Portable Antiquities Scheme such as: 2013 T368 (YORYM-878420), 2010 T252 (YORYM-F14744), and 2008 T239 (SWYOR-A44AE3). Further information on the form and type is outlined in Lewis, M (2013) 'Data Sheet 46, 'Crown and Heart' Buttons and Cufflinks', Finds Research Group AD700-1700. Conclusion: In terms of age and as the object contains a minimum of 10% precious metal it qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. Thanks: Thanks are extended to the finder of this object who provided images and dimensions of this object, allowing a full report to be made during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020.",

The assemblage comprises: 1 x copper alloy plumb bob (finder 1) 1 x copper alloy horse and rider figurine (finder 1) 1 x copper alloy and iron horse head probable key handle (finder 2) 1 x copper alloy probable sceptre head in the form of a bust (finder 1) Plumb bob A complete copper-alloy plumb bob, conical and solid with a blunted tip. The flat top bears concentric circular grooves. Projecting from its centre is a neck (11.6mm diameter at its narrowest) with concave sides, topped with a domed fungiform terminal (25.9mm diameter) with a flat underside. A circular hole (4.4mm diameter) at least 21.5 mm deep pierces the centre of the top of the domed terminal. Another circular hole crosses transversally through its neck (3.3mm diameter). The holes likely relate to the object’s suspension. The plumb bob has a smooth green patina with no decoration or marks, apart from a few small patinated dimples. 72.7mm long, 40.9mm diameter. 282g. Finder 1. Horse and rider figurine An incomplete and worn solid copper-alloy figurine of a horse and rider, cast in one. The rider sits astride the horse. The rider’s head is ovate, the face having very worn but quite well-modelled features in the right proportions. A helmet is delineated by moulded lines, with a worn and damaged crest. The right arm extends sideways at shoulder height and turns up at the elbow, the thinning forearm being broken at the wrist. A spur of twisted metal extends from the break towards the head. The patina is missing, revealing brass. This would have held a now lost spear. The left arm extends forwards from the body of the rider just above waist height to the side of the horse’s head, also reducing in diameter below the elbow. It terminates in a globular upward projection, a likely attachment for another element, probably a shield. The rider wears a belted and sleeved(?) tunic, with paired brace-like vertical lines on the back and chest perhaps rendering some decoration of the garment. Wear may obscure further detail in the middle. Beneath the prominent waistband is a pleated kilt. The legs are thick and appear a little short compared to the body. There may be a trace of footwear on the right leg. The horse is modelled in considerable detail, although some has been lost to damage to the top of the head, including parts of the leaf-shaped recessed ears and mane. The mane is a raised crest, decorated with parallel incised lines. Unusually the disc-like eyes stand in relief proud of the face, perhaps indicating that the horse wore a chamfron with eye protectors. Details of the horse’s bridle are also modelled in high relief, including a nose band, head band, and strap behind the ears which joins the others and leads to a bit. The reins, laying on the neck, would have run across the space between the chin and chest to join the bit, but these elements are now missing. The breaks are patinated. Also moulded is the girth as well as straps round the forequarters and rump and under the tail. All three extend from the same place, just behind the rider's thigh. The straps carry phalerae (discs) on each shoulder and haunch. The saddle is represented as two short prongs or ‘horns’ behind the rider. The horse’s right foreleg is lifted and the left foreleg straight, as if the animal is stepping forward. Both front hooves are missing, but the breaks are patinated. There is also a deep crack across the knee of the horse's left foreleg. The back legs are both bent, as if the horse is moving at a canter. The right leg has a deep crack across the lower portion. Muscles and bone are visibly modelled and the hooves are delineated by an incised groove. Projecting from the base of the rear hoofs are rounded pegs or extensions, perhaps to slot into a base. The tail, damaged at the tip, hangs following the line of the back legs and carries longitudinal incisions to suggest the strands of hair. The figurine has a smooth grey green patina, rougher and lighter over the damaged areas. It is 73.7mm long, 30mm wide across the rider's shoulders, and 86.8mm high. 222g. Finder 1. Horse head key handle An incomplete solid copper alloy zoomorphic handle, in the form of a horse protome (forequarters). Iron corrosion covers the flat face where the horse is truncated at the shoulder, with the corroded remains of an iron shank about 5mm long and 7.5mm across. The head is modelled in some detail, in particular the mane, eye and nostrils. A groove runs down the centre of the mane, incised on either side to mark its strands. The eyes are pointed ovates, set slightly lopsidedly on either side of the head, above which are the ovate ears laid flat against the mane. The nostrils are formed of shallow ovals. Below them is a wide mouth with teeth perhaps bared, but not defined in the moulding. There is a flattened facet on the front of the lower part of the neck, perhaps post-depositional damage, but patinated. The two forelegs extend forward from the animal, perhaps giving the impression of the horse in motion at a canter, though this is also a common position of legs in these protome figures. The forelegs terminate in moulded hooves, with recent damage to the tip of one. The object has a smooth grey green patina. 52mm long, 17.7mm wide and 48mm high. 90g. Finder 2. Direct parallels are not yet known to us but and what survives of the shank suggests its square profile, as would be expected for a key and the handle has very close echoes of known zoomorphic key handle types. Some key handles represent horses in the form of a head emerging from a calyx (Artefacts CLE-4111). Others are in very similar animal protome form, including panthers and lions (Artefacts CLE-4054; CLE-4125). Sceptre head bust An incomplete hollow copper-alloy stylised male bust with detailed modelling of hair and facial features. The top of the head is domed and smooth, with hair and beard forming a continuous wide fringe around the face. Twisting short tufts of hair curl up from the temples, swept back and arranged somewhat symmetrically in the centre. Curvilinear incisions represent individual strands. The ears are represented as single spiralling curls, expanding at the spiral’s inner terminus and standing proud of the head. The short beard and moustache are similarly modelled to the hair, the beard lengthening towards the chin where it bifurcates in two principal curls. The lentoid eyes are emphasised with an incised outline, turning downward at their outer extremities. The pupils are perforations 5.8mm and 6mm in diameter. These may originally have held separate coloured elements but there is no surviving evidence for this, nor on the reverse. The eyes are framed by prominent curving brows which extend into the high ridge of the sub-triangular nose with slightly recessed nostrils at its base. The slot-like mouth is framed by thin lips modelled as two straight raised ridges, slightly parted. The ‘step’ or raised line where the neck widens to join the thin spatulate chest plate may represent some form of clothing. Three rivet holes are visible on the front of the chest plate, with a break on the rim of the plate extending to join with the central hole. A narrow crack also runs between this rivet hole and another to its left. The undamaged hole is 2.7mm diameter. The other two are larger. The rivet holes suggest a means of fixing the bust to another element. At the sides of the neck are the remains of two copper alloy rivets, one on each side, next to the opening in the back of the bust. They project both outside and inside the wall of the neck. These would have allowed the separate backplate to be attached, and there are no other fixings for the backplate evident. The interior of the head has a rough surface. The backplate, now detached, is a 1mm thick sheet of copper alloy and has a torn rivet hole of 2.5mm diameter that articulates with the rivet on the bust's left. The sides of the backplate are bent round the outside of the neck and cover the whole of the opening in the back of the bust from the rivets upwards. A line of differential patination on the back of the head shows how far the backplate reached when attached, and there is a matching line on the back of the backplate. The backplate’s edges are damaged, with some parts missing, and it is torn across the middle. This looks to be more recent damage with the broken edge showing as a brassier colour. The backplate is 63.9mm long, 40.6mm wide and 7mm thick as bent to fit round the neck. 13g. It has a pitted dusty grey green patina. The edges of the backplate would have been visible from the front when in position on the back of the head. The hole at the base where the backplate and front of the sceptre head meet would have allowed for the entry for the pole or staff on which is was mounted. The bust has a smooth olive-green patina and, noting the damage to the backplate, is otherwise in very good condition. It is 130mm long, 78mm wide across the shoulders, 63mm wide across the upper head, 44mm thick across the nose, 51mm thick across the upper head and 23mm thick across the neck. 417g. Discussion The following discussion incorporates comments from John Pearce, Senior Lecturer in Archaeology, King's College London, with additional comment by Martin Henig, Institute of Archaeology, Oxford University. Plumb bob The plumb bob is of a similar form to many from Roman contexts including an example from the Pitt-Rivers collection of the British Museum: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1975-0429-6. They were used by surveyors, carpenters etc. Martin Henig notes the following parallels. ‘It ‘the plumb bob] conforms to the Roman shape cf. Boon, Silchester. The Roman Town of Calleva (1974) pp.200 and 227, fig.35 no.8 from Silchester and J.-P. Adam, Roman Building. Materials and Techniques (1994),p.42 fg 84 from Rome.’ Horse and rider figurine Horse and rider figurines are documented in more than 25 examples in Britain, this being the northernmost yet known (most are in a zone extending from north Lincolnshire to Wiltshire) (Durham 4.4.1). Integrally cast examples are not common and tend, like this one, to be modelled with slightly greater finesse, as seen in the facial features, details of dress and harness and so on (see also CAM-88F808). To judge from other examples and from the figures in other media to which the horse and riders are related, the raised right hand probably held a spear and the left had a shield attached to it. All of these figures differ slightly in their details and this is no exception, above all in the detailing of the horse harness. The god is usually taken to be a provincial translation of the god Mars. Sceptre head bust The size of the head, its portrait features which resemble those of Antonine emperors - Antoninus Pius, Lucius Verus, Marcus Aurelius, Commodus (AD 138-192), and the evidence for its being mounted all give this object an affinity with the terminals in the form of bearded male heads argued to be parts of sceptres or similar portable images of the emperor (Esposito 2019). The stylization of the portrait is remarkable, especially the hair, and is similar in spirit to other examples, especially the Steane (Brackley), head (BERK-E24C84; Walker 2014). This latter is thought to depict Marcus Aurelius and a similar attribution is possible for the current example, though its stylization makes a definitive identification impossible. Like the horse and rider, again this is the northernmost find of an object of this type. With the exception of the Mars sceptre heads from a burial at Brough-on-Humber, other finds are all from eastern and central England south of the Humber (Esposito 2019: 37-47, fig. 3.16, p. 63). The presence of the sceptre head gives the deposit a likely second century date or later. Association Dr Pearce suggests two possible reasons for this group of material being found together. 1. The diverse nature of the objects, a key handle, sceptre tip, plumb bob and figurine, suggest an interpretation as a miscellaneous collection of scrap bronze, some of which comes from a ritual context. Compare for example the ‘near Gloucester’ hoard, recently found by metal-detectorists (Coombe and Henig 2020). 2. A more likely possibility is that this is a ritual deposit. Sceptres in the form of emperors, gods, animals etc are likely priestly regalia and have been recurringly documented in structured deposits of likely votive origin. Most examples come from the environs of the Fens, and instances from temple sites are occasionally known, e.g. Wanborough Surrey (Esposito 2019). The horse and rider figurine would also fit a votive context, given its likely identification with Mars. The presence of the horse protome from the key handle might also be explained through its secondary use as a substitute votive for animal sacrifice. Similar deposits with which the Ryedale group could find parallels include the 1857 discovery at Willingham Fen, Cambridgeshire, initially published by Rostovsteff and Mattingly (1923) and the 1844 discovery at Felmingham Hall, Suffolk. The former comprised sceptre heads, including one head in the form of Antoninus Pius (rather than Commodus), two horse and rider figurines, other mounts in human and animal form and other fittings and beads, likely deposited together in a wooden box.. Similarly the Felmingham hall assemblage, deposited in a clay cauldron, included a copper alloy head of Jupiter, also in two pieces with a rivet for attachment at the neck, as well as other figurines, bases and mounts, spears, a miniature wheel and rattles (Esposito 2019: 67-72). The plumb bob is harder to parallel in assemblages of this type but reasons for its possible placing in a votive deposit can be suggested. In use in construction, its presence might be explained as a foundation offering related to some act of building related to the putative shrine from which the other pieces derive. Martin Henig notes: ‘Measuring instruments are often shown on dedications of tombstones for example , showing the monument was dedicated sub ascia, see CSIR 1. 9, my North-West Midlands fascicule , no.39.[p.15 and pl.16; no.63 on p.22 and pl.22; the words used on no,33 pp.12-13,pl.15 though no plumb bob shown... I suspect this [a plumb bob] was always a key object for demarcating sacred space with accuracy...It occurs in a number of Biblical verses with this connotation...and for quite an obvious reason..how else can an architect measure accurately?’ Alternatively, as a key component of the groma, the main survey instrument, the plumb bob’s presence might be an offering made during rituals associated with landscape re-organisation. In this connection the presence of the plumb bob has echoes of another find in the same region, the Piercebridge plough group, a copper alloy statuette found in the early 19th century and now in the British Museum (BM 1879,0710.1). The composition of the plough team, a cow and bull yoked together, suggests that this object is a likely votive model of the scene in which the furrow is cut to form the line of the pomerium, the symbolic boundary for towns of chartered status, realised on the ground in Britain in the ditches, banks and walls which made up urban circuits (Manning 1971). The Ryedale group is somewhat closer to such towns than the Piercebridge find, with Aldborough being c. 20 km to the south-west in the vale of York. As well as creating town boundaries other surveying operations which might need a ritual sanction can be conjectured. It has proved hard to find convincing traces of the regular parcelling up of expropriated territory (centuration) in Britain but other changes within the wider setting of the find might provide a context for survey operations. The alignment of roads running to the frontier in the north and branching west and east into the Pennines and vale of Pickering respectively, would have required survey in advance. The presence of garrisons, for example at Malton to the east, the development of villas (Beadlam and Hovingham are also only a few kilometres east of the findspot) would all have likely seen expropriation and re-allocation of land with concomitant measuring and marking out and perhaps divine approval through sacrifice. It may be possible to test these conjectures further if fuller context information becomes available.

The exterior surface of the hoop is decorated with a series of repeated transverse zig-zag grooves, some rubbed. The interior surface of the ring bears raised capitalised text reading \"[. – raised dot] AS FAYTHFVL [. – raised dot] AS [. – incised dot] FRENDLY”. Two quatrefoil designs formed of inwardly pointing arrows are present between the end and start of the text. No makers mark is present. Patches of a dark green substance, possibly enamel, are retained in the areas around the raised text, suggesting that the text appeared against a green ground. Dimensions: Diameter: 18mm; Width: 4mm; Thickness: 1mm; Weight: 3.1g. Discussion: Finger-rings bearing affectionate inscriptions are known as posy-rings after the short mottos and verses engraved/inscribed on their hoops, often on the interiors. However, inscriptions set in reserves flooded with enamel appear most commonly to be mourning rings. Examples in the BM collection are predominantly of rings with exterior enamelling. Enamelling is less known on the interior of rings. The BM rings are overwhelmingly eighteenth century. No rings with the motto ‘As faithful as friendly’ are in the BM collection, but an example with spellings ‘FREND’ and ‘FAYTH’ in capitals has been attributed to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (1961,1202.396). The capitalised font is consistent with an eighteenth-century date. A similar ‘quatrefoil’ design can be seen on the exterior of BM AF.1621, which also bears a capitalised inscription reserved in enamel and the date 1745. Further similar ‘quatrefoil’ designs can be seen on the exteriors BM AF.1624, which also bears a capitalised inscription reserved in enamel and the date 1770, BM AF.1627, which bears a capitalised inscription reserved in enamel and the date 1788, and BM AF.1628, which also bears a capitalised inscription reserved in enamel and the date 1792. A green enamel reserve with text can be seen on the exterior of AF.1635 (inscribed 1715). On balance, it is likely that this ring was made in the period after 1720. There is wear to the exterior of the ring, especially around the highest point of the band, suggesting that that the incised lines may not have anchored enamel, or perhaps that enamel was only confined to the rim sections of the exterior band",

          "label": "A Late Medieval lead alloy cross and pellets token, London series,&nbsp;AD&nbsp;1425-1490. The obverse has a vulva&nbsp;(the outer part of the female genitals), in the field surrounded by a border of oblique rays. The reverse has a central short cross pattee with a ring and dot in each angle surrounded by a border of oblique rays. The oblique rays run in a clockwise direction upon both faces suggesting a London rather than Paris origin. Mitchiner and Skinner (1984:94) write &quot;a significant number of &#39;cross and pellets&#39; tokens have been recovered alongside coins of Henry VII, suggesting that they remained in use until the beginning of the sixteenth century. But as these tokens barely entered the phase of renewed use of tin it is unlikely that the actual manufacture of &#39;cross and pellets&#39; tokens lasted beyond about 1490.&quot; The token has a parallel in Mitchiner and Skinner (1984:95&nbsp;No.18) Dimensions: diameter: 11.89mm; weight: 0.47g Mitchiner and Skinner (1984:94) write &quot;All &#39;cross and pellets&#39; tokens so far inspected (English provenance) show the ray border orientated in the same direction on both obverse and reverse of the specimen. But several specimens illustrated by Forgeais (Paris provenance) show different orientations of the ray border on obverse and reverse. The dominant series of &#39;cross and pellets&#39; tokens bears a dot-in-circle in each angle of the cross and typically has a clockwise ray border and also expanded ends to the arms of the cross. Diverging from this standard form one can observe a number of variants. Tokens bearing a single dot in each angle of the cross normally have an anti-clockwise ray border and a cross with straight arms. Tokens made of pewter, a late characteristic, also all have an anti-clockwise ray border. This anti-clockwise form of ray border which is, so far as one can judge, a late evolutionary form also occurs on nearly all tokens which have three pellets in each angle of the cross. One should emphasise that although these observations may help to define evolutionary tendencies, they do not demarcate any exclusive class of token.&quot; References: Mitchiner, M. and Skinner, A. 1984.

This is surrounded by a bright gold dappled background, which in turn is circled by the words 'Stockport Harriers Club -1930' in a border. The recessed areas around the letters and background of th shield are now rose gold in colour although a patch of blue by one of the letters may be enamel. On the reverse within a raised border there is inscribed 'E. BARNES' / 'CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPION'. The makers mark at the bottom of the reverse read 'LP & A' (Lloyd, Paine & Amiel). The hallmarks indicate it is 9ct gold, hallmarked at the Birmingham Assay in 1929. At the top of the medal is a separate applied foliate attachment which has two branches curving to the centre where there is a circular loop. There is a separate rose gold or copper free running loop through this upper loop. The diameter of the medal is 28.7mm, 38.1mm high with the attachment piece and 2.5mm thick and weighs 15.35g. The Stockport Harriers club was formed when the Reddish, Marple, & Davenport Harriers decided to amalgamate in September 1911 as stated in the Northern running guide [accessed 15/10/19: https://northernrunningguide.com/news/centenary-celebrations-for-stockport-harriers].",

It is decorated with incised double linee inlaid with niello forming cross hatching on the front and two pairs of parallel diagonal lines on the reverse. The two arms are cylindrical in shape, with debased animal heads adjacent to the cnetral block, mouth outwards. The heads are formed of two ridges, with the outer ridge closer to the length of the bar (the mouth) flaring outwards, forming a triangle in cross section as opposed to a gently rounded D-shape. The bars end is very worn and rounded breaks. The loop has a small conical neck and a large elongated oval loop at the top. At the base of the conical neck and passing through the central block is a narrowed bar that has a flat circular knop at the base. It is 66.6mm in width across the arms, and 57.7mm in height from the bar to the loop terminal. The arms are 6.7mm thick and the loop is 3.1mm thick. It weighs 43.59g.

The gilded lozenge-shaped backplate has a rounded, slightly concave knop at each corner with a smaller spherical knop at the midpoint between each. Above this is an ungilded silver element consisting of four three-dimensional trefoils extending from the centre to form a cross, now slightly out of line with the lozenge backplate. Both backplate and cross of trefoils are held in place by a central dome-headed split-pin; on the reverse, the two halves of the split-pin have been bent out at right-angles and exhibit hammer marks. Below, the hook has been soldered on; the soldered end is flattened, expanding into a cylindrical rod which ends in an old break. There are the lumpy remains of solder on the reverse, at the top of the hook and further up where a second soldered-on element, an attachment loop, is missing. Dimensions: Length 29mm, maximum width 19.5mm, minimum width 2.2mm, thickness 7.8mm, weight 4.1g. Date: c. AD 1500 - 1600.

The base is circular and the partial remains of a makers identification stamp is present. It reads: BY / INS LT / (DOT)/ LONDON / ENGLAND. An irregular hole is present in the base. It measures 28.6 mm tall, 11.0 mm diameter at the rim, and 17.4 mm diameter at the base. It weighs 16.8 g. The milk churn is a mid grey colour with an even surface patina. Two similar toy milk churns have been recorded on the PAS database. These are SUSS-753154 and SUSS-949A95, both are considered to be Georgian to Victorian in date. Due to the similarities between those examples and this one, a similar date is recommended.",

The key can be described in several sections: The bow or handle, shank and bit. The bow consists of a vertical oval, with an oval cross section. It is 36.1 mm&nbsp;tall and 25.6 mm&nbsp;wide. The shank is attached to the bow at the mid point of the right hand side. The shank consists of an rod, rectangular in plan and circular in cross section. It swells in the middle of the shank, with a collar just before the bit. It is 96.4 mm&nbsp;long and has a diameter of 9.4 mm. The shank projects 10.1&nbsp;mm&nbsp;past the end of the bit. The bit is rectangular in plan and cross section. It extends below the shank 19.7 mm&nbsp;and is 19.2 mm&nbsp;wide and 7.0 mm&nbsp;thick.. The wards appear to surround a central capital I shaped opening.&nbsp; The key measures 121.7 mm&nbsp;in length, 9.5 mm&nbsp;wide and is 36.1 mm&nbsp;tall. It weighs 74.3 g. The key is a dark green colour and has an even patina.&nbsp; A number of very similar rotary keys are shown in G. Egan&#39;s &#39;Medieval Households&#39; pages 111-119. From the size of the key and the presence of a solid shank it is likely that the key would have been used to lock a door rather than a casket or chest. Chest locks tend to have a hollow shank and are significantly smaller (ibid: 111). The keys illustrated in this volume are all dated from the late 12th - to late 14th centuries (AD&nbsp;1150 -&nbsp;AD&nbsp;1400). Therefore a similar date is suggested here for this example.

It is uncertain what type of vessel this leg comes from, but Egan (1998) comments that commonly used cooking vessels in the Medieval period include skillets, ewers, and cauldrons. Egan (1998) illustrates similar vessel legs with a transverse ridge on page 165. One example is unstratified and the other dates to cica&nbsp;AD&nbsp;1400-1450. According to Butler, Green and Payne (2009), &quot;From about (AD&nbsp;1100), cast copper alloy vessels...were commonly used for downhearth cooking, with the vessel sitting among the embers or suspended over the fire. All but the poorest medieval or post-medieval households would have had at least one metal cooking vessel....These vessels gradually passed out of use between 1700 and 1850, superseded by cast iron pots...&quot;.&nbsp; There are many cooking vessels recorded on the database (SWYOR-9EC4DC) was discovered in the Wakefield district of Yorkshire and (WAW-B324BC) discovered in the Stratford Upon Avon district of Warwickshire.

Spindle whorls, as an artefact type, can be hard to date accurately as they remained in use for a long period of time, however lead alloy spindle whorls of this type are normally attributed to the Medieval period (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;1100 to 1450AD). The weight of the spindle whorl is suggestive of a thick linen or wool fibre being spun, as there is a direct relationship between the weight of the whorl and the thickness of the resulting thread. Fine threads such as silk require a lighter whorl than those used to spun wool or linen.",
